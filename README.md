  <h4>🧑‍💻 About Me</h4>
  <p>
  I'm a B.Sc. student in Artificial Intelligence at FPT University (FPTU) in Vietnam, currently working as a Research Assistant at the AI Technology and Application Research Lab (AiTa Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Duc Ngoc Minh Dang. I have a strong passion for designing advanced systems and enjoy tackling challenging problems in Data Structures & Algorithms. My current research interests focus on signal processing, multimodal learning, and graph neural network learning, as well as their applications to audio/speech tasks. I also enjoy exploring computer vision and anime image generation through small personal projects.
